The goal of this analysis is to identify trends and opportunities within the agricultural sector across various countries and crops using the FAOSTAT dataset. 
By analysing key agricultural metrics such as area harvested, yield, and production volumes, we aim to uncover potential markets for agribusiness expansion. 
This analysis seeks to guide strategic decisions for international expansion by pinpointing regions with favourable agricultural trends and robust production capabilities.
